# Password Manager
## Description
Creating new accounts on the websites is easier than ever before. The only thing that's bothersome about it is creating a new password every single time! With the help of this password manager, generating a new strong password and remembering it is as easy as counting 1, 2, 3 :)

This program uses TKinter as the main package for the user interface (UI). If the user is not able to come up with a password, they can select "Generate Password" and a random password will be automatically created for them and copied to the clipboard. All data will be added to a JSON file and updated accordingly. Users can also download a text file of all the websites and their respective emails and passwords that they have entered by clicking the "Get All Passwords" button.
